# Lob-API-Demo
Demo Web App for application process at Lob. 
Front end designed with SASS for styling, React.js, and Bootstrap 3 for Grid Sizing.  

Backend API calls created using Node.js

Notes: 
--- Please swap out API Keys for LOB in 'index.js'.
--- My Google API key may expire 10/18/2016 because now they want to charge me for stuff :/ 

Thanks for checking out this demo of the LOB API.
